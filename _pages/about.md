I am a computational biologist with a strong interest in cancer genomics, mutational processes, and the development of computational methods for driver mutation discovery. I recently completed my PhD under the supervision of Professor Anna Panchenko at the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queenâ€™s University. My research integrates large-scale cancer genomics data with machine learning and structural modeling to understand the molecular mechanisms driving cancer development.

Currently, I am continuing my work in the Panchenko Lab, focusing on the discovery of rare driver mutations.
